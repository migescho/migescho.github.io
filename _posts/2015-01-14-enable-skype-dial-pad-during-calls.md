Sometimes you need in Skype a dial pad during a call, for example if you are connected to a conferece system and you need to enter a conference id.

Unfortunately the dial pad is hidden in linux skype 4.3. 

You can make the button, that opens the dial pad, visible by typing the hotkey "d" during your call.
