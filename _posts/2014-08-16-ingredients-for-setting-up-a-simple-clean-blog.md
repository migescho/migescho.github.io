The main ingredients for this blog are:

* Markdown for editing posts and pages.
* [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for creating static pages out of markdown files.
* Slightly modified [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) as a nice simple theme.
* [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting.

I got the inspiration for setting up the blog this way, through a very nice post from Joshua Lande: [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)
