![Michael Scholze](/assets/portrait.jpg)

I am a German physicist (PhD) who works most of the time as software engineer. During the last years I engaged in middle and large scale java projects as technical lead. Currently I put my focus on:

* Long term efficiency of software development processes. 
* Keeping a code base maintainable. 
* Clean Code a la Robert Martin.
* Refactoring, TDD, automatic testing.
* Transfer a non maintainable legacy code base into a maintainable one.

You can contact me via [e-mail](/contact).
